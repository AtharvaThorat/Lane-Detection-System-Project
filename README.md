# 🛣️ Lane Detection & Enhanced Road Safety System

> **"Empowering Smarter Roads for Safer Journeys"**

This project is a **fusion of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning**, designed to revolutionize road safety through **real-time lane, pothole, traffic signal, and zebra crossing detection**.

Developed as part of an academic research and engineering initiative, this project integrates **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **Python** to create an **Enhanced Road Detection System** — a prototype that embodies the foundation of *Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS)*.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern traffic systems are complex, unpredictable, and prone to hazards. This project tackles that challenge head-on by giving vehicles the power of **vision** — to recognize lanes, detect potholes, identify zebra crossings, and interpret traffic signals in real-time.

**Core Mission:**  
> To create a multi-functional, AI-powered road safety module that reduces accidents, enhances lane discipline, and improves awareness of road anomalies.

## ⚙️ System Capabilities

### 🧭 1. Lane Detection
- Detects and highlights road lane boundaries in real time using **OpenCV**.
- Assists in maintaining lane discipline and preventing lane departure accidents.
- Optimized for different light and weather conditions.

### 🕳️ 2. Pothole Detection
- Utilizes **YOLOv8** models trained on custom datasets.
- Detects and flags potholes for preventive maintenance and safety alerts.
- Supports dynamic road analysis for urban and highway conditions.

### 🦓 3. Zebra Crossing Recognition
- Detects pedestrian crosswalks to alert drivers.
- Enhances pedestrian safety by early warning systems for crossings.

### 🚦 4. Traffic Signal Recognition
- Identifies traffic light colors and statuses.
- Helps vehicles respond appropriately to changing signals.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

### 🎥 Step 1: Input
The user selects or provides a **road video** through the UI or command line.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Processing
- **OpenCV** handles frame-by-frame extraction and preprocessing.  
- **YOLOv8** detects road anomalies (potholes, signals, zebras).
- **Computer Vision** algorithms trace lane boundaries dynamically.

### 💡 Step 3: Output
- A processed **output video** is generated with visual overlays for each detection type.
- Results are saved in the `/Lane_Detect_Output` directory.
- Real-time GUI updates show live progress and preview results.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Each subsystem was validated using sample test cases:

| Test Module         | Description                             | Output                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Lane_Detection.py` | Detects and highlights lanes from video | Green overlay lines    |
| `test.py`           | Detects potholes via YOLO model         | Red bounding boxes     |
| `zebra.py`          | Detects zebra crossings & signals       | Blue highlights        |
